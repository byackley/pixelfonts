* (prefix).png
  * Characters corresponding to Unicode code points U+(prefix)00 to U+(prefix)FF. In color where applicable (e.g. for emoji)
* (prefix)_E.png
  * Emoji variants of normally colorless text figures. If a cell here is blank, the corresponding character has no color variant. Note that most emoji will just be in color all the time without text-mode variants; these glyphs are intended for expliclt color styling as needed. There are currently no plans to make text-mode variants of normally-color emoji.

  * A grid of regional-flag emoji, organized by row and column running A-Z (see <https://github.com/kreativekorp/vexillo> for the grid it was based on)

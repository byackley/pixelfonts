# pixelfonts

## What are these?

These are tiny monospaced pixel fonts in a variety of sizes. These top-level directories are all named after the pixel size of a single character, and the files within are named for the 256-character segment of Unicode they contain (so, for instance, 02.png in any directory will contain U+0200 through U+02FF).

All of the files are PNGs, with a transparent background and a default character color of white (although emoji and other characters can be in color). This is to make them easily recolorable using a "multiply" operation.
